|| Your Ascendant ||
Nakshatra is the term for lunar mansion in Hindu astrology. A nakshatra is one of 27 (sometimes also 28)
sectors along the ecliptic. Each nakshatra is further subdivided into quarters (or padas). These play a role in
popular Hindu astrology, where each pada is associated with a syllable, conventionally chosen as the first
syllable of the given name of a child born when the moon was in the corresponding pada.
Your Nakshatra : PURVAPHALGINI
Your Nakshatra Pada : 3
Purvaphalgini Nakshtra Prediction : You know a lot about music, arts, and literature because these things
are of your interest from the childhood. Your thinking pattern is quite peaceful. You like to live your life on the
path of truthfulness. Love is the most important thing in your life. You try to stay away from violence and
arguments because you are a peace lover. When there is an issue, you try to find a solution in a very peaceful
manner. But, when it comes on your self-respect, you just overpower your opponents. Also, you know very well
how to welcome friends and good people. Being intuitive, you already know what other people are thinking. By
nature, you are quite generous and love to travel. You like to work honestly and for the growth in life, you
always chose the true and righteous path. In life, you will get special fame in a field. Still, you might feel
restless. For helping others, you appear before even their request because you are compassionate. You are a
freedom lover. Hence, you don’t like any boundations. You just don’t like to do anything that causes
dependency on others. There is another quality in you that you never pamper your seniors even in job, which
causes you the loss of benefits from your seniors. As you have a sacrificial mentality, you would not like to take
any benefit from others. You have a special attachment with the family and you always stay ready to dedicate
everything to your family.
Education & Income : You will keep on changing your profession. Age 22, 27, 30, 32, 37, and 44 will stay
important for job and business. Favorable professions for you are government job; higher official; women
clothings, accessories, and cosmetics production or distribution; entertainer; model; photographer; singer; actor;
musician; wedding dress creator, accessories, and gifts business; biologist; goldsmith; works related to cotton,
wool, or silk; etc.
Family Life : Your familial life will be happy. Spouse and children will be of good behavior and you will get
enough happiness from them. Your life partner will be trustworthy and will be ready to sacrifice everything for
the welfare of the family. You may go for love marriage or marriage with a known person.

|| Nakshatra Phal ||
Character
You are an energetic person, never satisfied unless you are up and doing. You are strong in mind and strong in
body and full of enthusiasm for the work in hand. You have unlimited courage, and all these qualities combined
tend to make your life varied. You are not going to stay at one thing just because you have set out in that
direction. You will change your job, your friends, your hobbies or anything whatsoever provided you think the
change is for better. Unfortunately for you, you will not always count up the pros and cons of the change as
carefully as you should and this impulsiveness may often lead you into difficulties. Still you have a courage,
you are a born fighter and are endowed with plenty of enterprise. All of which will enable you to succeed in the
end.It is unlikely that you will amass great wealth but money is only useful for the happiness it can bring and of
happiness you will have your full shape and more.There are many reasons for thinking that you will move from
place to place a good deal and probably you will see much of the world. If a man, you are likely to take up posts
in various parts of the country, and, if a woman, it would not be surprising if you called upon to travel because
of the requirements of your partner's business or profession.We would suggest that you should endeavor to
cultivate the quality of patience, and that you reason out the cost more thoroughly before embarking upon some
fresh enterprise. There are little points but they help to mar your success. Moreover, avoid being a rolling stone
(avoid changes) especially after the age of 35.
Happiness And Fulfillment
You are a person who live in fantasy. Hypersensitive, many of you have inferiority complexes, feeling slighted
by taking the most unrelated incident as personal insult. It is important that you do not indulge in drugs or
alcohol, for this adds to your unclarity. You be honest with yourself and others, and attempt to be as realistic as
possible, for you tend toward escapism. Music, colours and nature are very positive in smoothing your overly
sensitive being.
Life Style
Your friends serve as motivational factors in your life. You need their support and encouragement. You can
thus achieve your goals by directing yourself in areas where your friends see your progress.

|| Life Predictions ||
Career
Because you are sensitive to any happenings in your career life, you prefer to have jobs which require little
hassle and pressure. Aiming your vocational directions with this in mind will result in a career of performance.
Occupation
You have an excellent memory, excellent health, and plenty of force in your character. All this makes it clear
that you were born to command. It hardly matters what the particular line of occupation is, You should do well
in it. But where you will chafe is in passing up from junior posts to the executive positions. If promotion is
slow, you may become despondent and even spoil your chances by plain speaking. Once you climb up the
ladder and reach a good height, your abilities will establish you firmly. From this, it is seen that you will fare
better in the higher ranks of service than in the lower. Clearly, it will be wise for you to go cautiously while
getting your footing.
Health
You put a high price on your comforts. As an outcome of this trait, you are something of a gourmet and enjoy
your food. In fact, you do not eat to live but, rather, live to eat. It is not surprising, then, to find that your
digestive apparatus will be the portion of your body which will give you the most concern. Do not neglect such
ailments as indigestion and, when they come, do not try to cure them by means of drugs. Take moderate
exercise such as walking and mild physical jerks. Breathe plenty of fresh air, put yourself on a rational diet and
eat fruit. However, if it prolongs you must visit a doctor. After fifty years of age, beware of inertia. You will be
apt to give up this and that, and grow into an individual who loses his hold on life. Keep up your interest in
things, develop your hobbies and remember that nobody can grow old if they mix with younger people than
themselves.

Hobbies
You will take up many hobbies. You will become very much wrapped-up in them. Then, suddenly you will lose
patience and cast them aside. Another will be chosen and it will suffer the same fate in due course. You will
proceed through life in this manner. On the whole, your hobbies will afford you considerable pleasure. You will
learn much from them, seeing that you will sample so many.
Love Matters
Love comes early in your life and when it comes, it strikes a very ardent note. But big flames die out quickly
and you are out of love many times before the final choice is made. Probably, the wedding will not be an early
one, nevertheless, it will be a happy one.
Finance
In matters of finance you will be fortunate and will be likely to acquire considerable wealth. You will be careful
in speculation, investing your money in solid concerns and in building up industry and business. As a rule, you
will be more lucky in money matters than otherwise, having much given to you and meeting great opportunities.
If you had to go into business you would make a success of enterprises connected with the luxurious side of life
more than any other, such things as the decorations of homes, millinery, dresses and flower shops, the catering
of food, restaurants or hotels. Your class of brain is of a very clever order but so quick and versatile that you
would tired easily of any routine or monotonous life.

Education
You are a sensible person by nature, which will also help you to handle various situations in life. You are likely
to experience obstacles in your studies but will face each and every situation without succumbing to fear. Your
urge to acquire more and more knowledge will help you climb the ladder of success. In the initial phase of your
life, you may encounter certain difficulties, but you will prove to be lucky in your studies solely because of your
concentration skills. Sometimes, you may find it difficult to remember certain things, but thinking hard during
such time can make everything crystal clear. This aspect of your character will help you to succeed in the realm
of your studies.

|| Life Predictions ||
Generally Manglik Dosha is considered from the position of Lagna and Moon in the birth chart.
In the birth chart, Mangal is placed in Second house from Lagna, while in the Moon chart Mangal is placed in
Fourth house.
Hence Mangal Dosha is not present in Lagna Chart while present in Moon Chart.
Mangal Dosha is considered to create hurdles in the married life of a person. According to some, Mangal Dosha
results in frequent illness or ultimately death of partner(s).
It is considered that if a manglik person marries to another manglik person then the manglik dosha gets
cancelled and has no effect.
Some Remedies (in case Mangal Dosha is present)
Remedies (needs to be performed before marriage)
Kumbha Vivah, Vishnu Vivah and Ashwatha Vivah are the most popular remedies for Mangal Dosha.
Ashwatha vivaha means the marriage with peepal or banana tree and cutting the tree after that. Kumbha Vivah,
also called Ghata Vivaha, means marriage with a pot and breaking it after that.
Remedies (can be performed after marriage)
1.Keep Kesariya Ganapati (Orange coloured idol of Lord Ganesha) in worship room and worship daily.
2.Worship Lord Hanuman by reciting Hanuman Chalisa daily.
3.Mahamrityunjaya paath (recitation of Mahamrityunjaya mantra).
Remedies (based on Lal Kitab, can be performed after marriage)
1.Feed birds with something sweet.
2.Keep ivory (Haathi Daant) at home.
3.Worship banyan tree with milk mixed with something sweet.
Note: We strongly recommend you to consult an astrologer before performing these remedies by your own.

Shani Sade Sati: Rising Phase
This is starting period of Shani's Sade Sati. In this period Saturn will be transiting in 12th house from the Moon.
It generally indicates financial loss, problems by hidden enemies, aimless travel, disputes, and poverty. During
this period, you may face problems created by your hidden enemies. Relationship with your colleagues will not
good enough and they will create problems in your work environment. You may also face challenges on your
domestic front. This may create pressure and tension. You need to exercise control over your spending
otherwise it be lead to bigger financial problems. Long distance travels may not be fruitful during this period.
Saturn’s nature is of delay and dejection, but generally you will get results eventually, so be patient and wait for
your turn. Take this period as learning period, put your hard work and things will fall in place. You are advised
not to take high risks in business matters in this period.
Shani Sade Sati: Peak Phase
This is the peak of Shani's Sade Sati. Generally this phase of Saturn is the most difficult one. Saturn transiting
over natal Moon indicates health problems, character assassination, problems in relationship, mental afflictions,
and sorrows. You will find it difficult to achieve success in this period. You may not get results of your hard
work and feel restricted. Your constitution and immune system will not be strong. As first house is the house of
health, you should start exercising and taking care of your health, otherwise you can be caught by chronic
diseases. You may suffer from depression, unknown fear or phobia. Your will lack clarity in thinking, action,
and decision making. You will be spiritually inclined and will be attracted by intricacies of nature. Acceptance
and doing basics right will sail you out of this period.
Shani Sade Sati: Setting Phase
This is 'setting' period of Shani's Sade Sati. Saturn will be transiting in the 2nd house from the natal Moon,
which indicates difficulty on financial and domestic front. You will start feeling slight relief after having two
difficult phases of Sade Sati. Still, misunderstandings and financial stress can be seen during this period.
Expenses may keep soaring high and you need to continue exercising control. Sudden financial losses and fear
of theft is also a possibility. You may be pessimistic in thinking, you are advised to deal with matters
enthusiastically. You will require paying good attention to family and personal front, otherwise those can also
lead to a bigger problem. For students, education may be slightly affected and they will have to work harder to
hold on to their existing level. Results will be slow and almost always with the delay. This is a period which
indicates danger and apart from other things, you need to be careful while driving. If possible, stay away from
non-veg and your drinking habits to keep Saturn happy. You will be able to sail through this period by
intelligently handling your domestic and financial matters.
Note: Above predictions are of general nature and are based on general belief that Sade Sati is harmful. Truly
speaking, we found that it is not always the case and we recommend reading this article on Sade Sati. Any
conclusion based on Sade Sati alone is not correct and has good chances of failing. Certain factors like current
running dasa and nature of Saturn also needs to be analyzed before we can conclude whether Sade Sati period
will be malefic or benefic. You are advised not to take above forecasts seriously and in case of any doubt,
consult a good astrologer.

Kalsarpa Dosh/Yog
As per the current definition, when all planets are situated in middle of Rahu and Ketu in birth-chart or
horoscope, the astrologers call it Kalsarp Dosh. In present days, discussions about this dosh are vogue among
Jyotishi or Hindu Astrologers of India. Many of troubles in one's life are mostly because of Kalsarp Dosh.
Without analyzing other areas of astrology, most astrologers, in fact, accept kalsarp dosh is main root of
problems. But the reality is this that if all planets are well posited in horoscope, kalsarp dosh will not be
harmful, and can be supportive to beneficial results endowed by good positions of planets. Kalsarp dosh is
inauspicious when positions of planets are unfavorable in one's horoscope. Therefore, it is not wise to fear
hearing just about 'Kalsarp Dosh'. It is in fact always better to reach on remedies only after consulting jyotishi
for deep analysis on negative influences of Kalsarp dosh. Interestingly, influence of kalsarp dosh is different in
different people. Because influence of kalsarp dosh is based on points-which sign is posited in which house, and
what other planets occupied that house, what are their influences and so on.
Result: Your Horoscope is free from Kalsarpa Yoga

|| Transit Today (1-5-2025) ||
Sun in your 1st house:
If benefic, the native will be fond of constructing religious buildings and digging of wells for public purposes.
He/She will have permanent source of livelihood- more from the government. Money earned from honest
sources will keep multiplying. He/She will believe only on own eyes, not in what is being heard.
 If malefic, the native's father may die in early childhood. Making love in the day time will make the wife
constantly ill and have infection of tuberculosis if Venus is placed in the 7th house. Malefic Sun in the 1st house
and Mars in the 5th house will cause the death of sons, one after the other. Similarly, the malefic Sun in the 1st
house and Saturn in the 8th house will cause the death of wives, one after the other. If there is no planet in the
7th house the marriage before 24th year will prove lucky for the native, otherwise the 24th year of the native
would prove highly disastrous.
 Remedial Measures
 (1) Marry before 24th year of life.
 (2) Avoid being intimate during the daytime.
 (3) Install a hand pump for water in your ancestral house.
 (4) Construct small dark room in the left side at the end of your house.

|| Lal Kitab Prediction ||
Moon in your 11th house:
This house is strongly influenced by Jupiter and Saturn. Every planet placed in this house will destroy its
inimical planets and the things associated with them. In this way the Moon here will destroy its enemy Ketu's
things, i.e., the sons of the native. Here the Moon will have to face the combined power of its enemies Saturn
and Ketu, which will weaken the Moon. Now if Ketu is placed in the 4th house, the life of the native's mother
will be endangered. The business associated with Mercury will also prove harmful. Starting house construction
or purchase of a house on Saturdays will strengthen the Saturn (the Moon's enemy) which will prove disastrous
for the native. Kanyadan after the midnight and participating in any marriage ceremony on Fridays will damage
the fortunes of the native.
 Remedies
 (1) Offer milk in Bhairo Mandir and donate milk to others liberally.
 (2) Ensure that the grandmother does not see her grandson.
 (3) Heat up a piece of gold in fire and put it in a glass of milk before drinking it.
 (4) Throw 125 pieces of sweet (Peda) in a river.
Mars in your 2nd house:
The native with Mars in the 2nd house is generally the eldest issue of parents, or else he or she would always
like to be treated so. But living and behaving like a younger brother would prove highly beneficial and ward off
several evils automatically. Mars in this house provides great wealth and properties from the in-laws' family.
Mars negative here makes the native a snake in disguise for others and causes death in war or quarrels.
 Mars with Mercury in the 2nd house weakens the will power and undermines the importance of the native.
 Remedies
 (1) The business associated with Moon, e.g., trade in cloth, will provide great prosperity, hence strengthen
Moon.
 (2) Ensure that your in-laws make arrangements for providing drinking water facilities to the common people.
 (3) Keep deer skin in the house.

Mercury in your 12th house:
Mercury here destroys night's sleep of the native and causes troubles of many sorts. He/She may lose peace of
mind and very often suffers from headache. He/She has a long life but suffers from Mercury, although,
however, if Mercury is accompanied by Saturn in this house very good results follow. Saturn along with sun
and Mercury in 12th house also gives good result. Daughters, sisters, father's sister and niece will be unhappy as
long as they are living in the native's house. Such persons are generally self praising and of irritable nature. If
something right or wrong goes into native’s mind, he/she will ensure to stick to it in every manner. If such a
native is fond of taking liquor he/she will be of pretentious nature. Speculation in business will prove harmful.
Marriage in the 25th year will prove harmful for the native's spouse and father.
 Remedies
 (1) Throwing new empty pitcher in a river.
 (2) Putting on a ring of stainless steel.
 (3) Putting kesar tilak on face, head and visiting religious places of worship.
 (4) Taking advice of another person before starting any new or important work.
Jupiter in your 2nd house:
The results of this house are affected by Jupiter and Venus as if they are together in this house, though Venus
may be placed anywhere in the chart. Venus and Jupiter are inimical to each other. Hence both will affect each
other adversely. Consequently, if the native engages himself in the trade of gold or jewelry, then the things of
Venus like wife, wealth and property will get destroyed.
 As long as two you are together, the native will continue gaining honour and wealth despite the fact that the
spouse and his/her family may be suffering because of ill health and other problems. The native is admired by
people of opposite sex and inherits the property of father. He/she may be benefited by lottery or property of a
person having no issues, if the 2nd, 6th and 8th houses are auspicious and Saturn is not placed in the 10th.
 Remedies
 (1) Charity and donations will ensure prosperity.
 (2) Offer milk to snakes for warding off the evils of Saturn placed in the 10th.
 (3) Fill up the pits if any on the road side, in front of your house.

Venus in your 1st house:
Venus in 1st house makes the native highly handsome, long lived, sweet tongued and popular among the
opposite sex. Spouse of the native remains ill. Religion, caste or creed is never a bar for having sexual relations
with anyone. Such a native is generally highly romantic by nature and longs for love and sex with other people

Shadbala is a method in Vedic astrology that gives quick insight in the strength of planets and the houses.
Sanskrit means 'Six' and hence Shadbala consists of 6 different sources of strength. Shadbala calculation is a
laborious process but thanks to computers one can get these strength calcualtions by just one mouse click.
Shadbala method gives a value to each planet and each house. The more points a planet and a house gets in
Shadbala the stronger it is.
